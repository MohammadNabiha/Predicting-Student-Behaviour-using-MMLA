# Predicting-Student-Behaviour-using-MMLA
This project uses Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) to predict behavior changes in students with Special Education Needs (SEN) undergoing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy. By combining diverse data sources—such as emotional state, physical movement, environmental conditions, and academic progress—we built predictive models that help educators and therapists support SEN students more effectively.
